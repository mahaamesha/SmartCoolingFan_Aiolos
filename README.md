# SmartCoolingFan_Aiolos
Aiolos is a smart cooling fan based arduino which can control speed of the fan using IC L293d by transmitting PWM signal for the DC motor on the fan. Its also use a temperature sensor, LM35. Simply, LM35 will receive temperature data every t milliseconds, then transfer it to arduino in millivolts. Programmed arduino will convert it to byte type data so that it can be transmitted as PWM signal via PWM pin to IC L293d. IC L293d will receive byte in range 0-255 which figured as speed of DC motor, actually. I also use IC L7805 for supply arduino via RAW pin, add 2 zener diode to prevent any short circuit opportunity, and add 1uF cappasitor as stabilizer for IC L293d.
